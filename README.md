## 👨‍💻 About me
- Frontend developer focused on **Vue, Nuxt, TypeScript, Vite** with an **AI-first mindset**.  
- Experienced in **project migrations & upgrades** (Vue 3.x → 3.5+, TypeScript/JS versions, Vite ecosystem).  
- Passionate about **performance, accessibility, and clean architecture** (SOLID principles, reusable components, async loads).  
- Daily routine: **track community trends** (LinkedIn, YouTube, Discord communities, RFCs, release notes) → experiment → document → deliver.  
- Comfortable with **CI/CD pipelines**, agile environments (**Jira, Slack**), and collaborative reviews (CodeRabbit, Sentry).  

---

## 🚀 Highlights
- **Project upgrades & refactoring** → migrated projects to latest Vue 3.5+, updated dependencies, resolved breaking changes.  
- **Performance practices** → code-split routes, async components, composables (VueUse), image optimization, prefetch/preload strategies.  
- **Collaboration & workflow** → fluent with **Jira & Slack** for team coordination; completed an incomplete **Scrum Mastering course** with solid agile knowledge.  
- **Automation & integrations** → hands-on with **n8n workflows**; configured real-time chat with **Chatwoot + Socket.io**.  
- **Custom dev** → built an **AI-powered PDF editor** from scratch.  
- **Design & tools** → daily use of **Postman, Figma, Canva**, and IDEs like **Cursor, VSCode, Qoder, Kiro**.  
- **Testing setup** → Playwright / Cypress for end-to-end flows, prevented regressions in auth & routing logic.  
- **CI/CD automation** → GitHub Actions workflows for lint, type-check, tests, and preview deploys.  
- **Accessibility care** → semantic HTML, keyboard navigation, IDE-enforced a11y rules via AI agents.  

---

## 🧠 AI-first workflow
- Scaffold components, composables, and tests with AI → refine manually.  
- Run **performance checks** (component/page level) directly in IDE + browser dev tools.  
- Generate docs, unit tests, and audit reports faster with prompt engineering.  
- Use AI as a **daily co-pilot** — inevitable and essential.  
- Built **AI-based internal tools** (e.g., PDF editor, automated code reviews).
